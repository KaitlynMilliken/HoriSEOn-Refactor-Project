# Code Refactor Starter Code


Welcome to the readme! If you've made it this far, here are a few things to note about this project..

This project code has all been refactored to better comply to SEO standards. Everyone wants to be found, right? Here we have better serviced our client by adding ALT attributes to our images, unfuddling our DIV soup by changing to semantic elements, and cleaning up some very redundent code. 

Hope you enjoy reading through some better (AKA more awesome) code! Rock on! ❤️
